## Design Philosophy

Inspired by Netflix's interface but focused on **discovery over browsing**. The goal is to eliminate decision paralysis and help users find great content they might otherwise miss.

## The Problem This Solves

**Before:** Spend 15-30 minutes scrolling through Netflix, Hulu, etc., often giving up and rewatching something familiar.

**After:** Get a curated suggestion in 2 seconds based on your exact preferences and available subscriptions.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Grid/Flexbox), Vanilla JavaScript
- **API:** Streaming Availability API via RapidAPI
- **Design:** Netflix-inspired UI/UX with CSS animations
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages with custom domain

## API Integration

- Fetches real-time streaming availability across 60+ countries
- Filters for subscription-only content (no rentals)
- Supports 25+ streaming services globally
- Includes movie posters, ratings, cast, and deep links

## Randomization Algorithm

The app uses a sophisticated randomization system:

1. **Varied API Queries** - Different sorting methods each spin
2. **Memory System** - Remembers last 25 movies to prevent immediate repeats
3. **Smart Filtering** - Adult-focused content with quality thresholds
4. **Fallback Logic** - Graceful handling when filter combinations return few results
